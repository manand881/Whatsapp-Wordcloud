It was dark
Looking up
Resolution
Our only hope
Came from the sun
We were lost, forgotten
But found our way back
To hear you say
When you fall away
That's the price you pay
When you crawl away
Aeromancy
It was bright
Looking down
Divining the skies around
Aeromancy
We were blind
Now we see
The price you pay
For what you say

*Break*

When you fall away
That's the price you pay
When you fall away
Aeromancy

*Break*

When you fall away
That's the price you pay
When you fall away
Aeromancy
